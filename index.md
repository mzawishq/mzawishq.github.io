<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Centre for Sustainable Digital Technologies at the [Technological University Dublin](https://www.tudublin.ie/), where I am working on the [Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)](https://www.sfi.ie/) project: SustAIn - Sustainable, Green and Energy Efficient Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Systems.

My research is broadly situated at the interface between **artificial intelligence** and **edge computing** (**Edge AI**) with applications in precision agriculture and healthcare. In particular, I attempt to solve problems related to energy efficiency, robustness, and scalability of computer vision applications in resource-constrained edge environments. To solve these issues, I developed novel model compression and optimization techniques to enable: i) **on-device training at the edge**, ii) **robustness to heterogeneous and intermittent resources**, and iii) **adaptability to data drift in real-world domains**. 

Previously, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at [Walton Institute](https://waltoninstitute.ie/), [South East Technological University, Ireland](https://setu.ie/) as a part of platform research in [SFI VistaMilk Center](https://vistamilk.ie/). I also spent time at [Saint Louis University](https://slu.edu/) collaborating with Networking Research Group as a part of my [EU NGI Enrichers Transatlantic Fellowship](https://enrichers.ngi.eu/).
